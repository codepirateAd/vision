		<h3>What is computer vision?</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>
			Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
		</li>
			<br>
		<li>
			Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. Human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving and whether there is something wrong in an image.
		</li>
			<br>
		<li>
			Computer vision trains machines to perform these functions, but it has to do it in much less time with cameras, data and algorithms rather than retinas, optic nerves and a visual cortex. Because a system trained to inspect products or watch a production asset can analyze thousands of products or processes a minute, noticing imperceptible defects or issues, it can quickly surpass human capabilities.
		</li>
			<br>

		<li>
			Computer vision is used in industries ranging from energy and utilities to manufacturing and automotive – and the market is continuing to grow.
		</li>

		<h3> Introduction to OpenCV </h3>
		<ol style="list-style: none;">
			<li>
			OpenCV ( Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source software library for computer vision and machine learning. OpenCV was created to provide a shared infrastructure for applications for computer vision and to speed up the use of machine perception in consumer products. OpenCV, as a BSD-licensed software, makes it simple for companies to use and change the code. There are some predefined packages and libraries that make our life simple and OpenCV is one of them.
			</li> <br>

			<li>
			Gary Bradsky invented OpenCV in 1999 and soon the first release came in 2000. This library is based on optimised C / C++ and supports Java and Python along with C++ through an interface. The library has more than 2500 optimised algorithms, including an extensive collection of computer vision and machine learning algorithms, both classic and state-of-the-art.
